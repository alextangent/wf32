     messages

stringtest.fth
   - renamed BUF to SUBBUF to avoid redefinition message

toolstest.fth
   - improved NAME>INTERPRET test
   - in >UPPERCASE replaced ?DO with IF etc as ?DO is Core Extension

Version 0.13.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blocktest.fth
   - fixed issue #7 faults with single buffer blocks

core.fth
   - corrected ACCEPT buffer block length to decimal 80 characters

coreplustest.fth 
   - moved double number with prefixes to doubletest.fth
   - now tests maximum length definition names and all graphical characters accepted
   - parses upper case characters using 'X' notation
   - tests FIND with zero length strings and non-existent names

doubletest.fth
   - received double number with prefixes from coreplus.fth

Version 0.13
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several files - TABs replaced with space characters as whether control
   characters are treated as spaces is system dependent

blocktest.fth
   - New test program

coreplustest.fth
   - TRUE changed to <TRUE> to use Core definitions

coreexttest.fth
   - <FALSE> and <TRUE> with FALSE and TRUE to avoid dependence on Core tests

   - Use of 2VARIABLE (in the optional Double number word set) replaced
     with CREATE.
   - Calls to COMPARE replaced by new definition STR= to avoid use of
     a word from an optional word set.
   - UNUSED tests revised as UNUSED UNUSED = may return FALSE when an
     implementation has the data stack sharing unused dataspace.
   - Double number input dependency removed from the HOLDS tests.
   - Minor case differences removed in definition names (all now in
     upper case).

doubletest.fth, facilitytest.fth, memorytest.fth
   - Assumptions and dependencies added or changed

errorreport.fth
   - includes block test report
   - improved display

exceptiontest.fth
   - Use of CASE etc replaced to avoid dependency on Core Ext

filetest.fth
   - S" in interpretation mode tested.
   - Added tests of SAVE-INPUT RESTORE-INPUT REFILL in a file, (moved from
     coreexttest.fth).
   - Calls to COMPARE replaced with STR= (in utilities.fth) 

localstest.fth
   - Priority of locals tests made conditional on the required search-order
     words being available from the Seach-order wordset

runtests.fth
   - includes blocktest.fth and utilities.fth

searchordertest.fth
   - Interpretive use of S" replaced by $" from utilities.fth
   - Replaced two instances of ?DO with DO (as ?DO is in the Core Ext word set) 

stringtest.fth
   - Interpretive use of S" replaced by $" from utilities.fth

tester.fr
   - Replaced Core Ext <> with = 0=

toolstest.fth
   - Additional tests on [ELSE] and [THEN]

utilities.fth
   - New file, included after Core tests, to provide various definitions for
     the remaining optional word set test programs.

Version 0.12
~~~~~~~~~~~~

core.fr
   - 2 lines > 80 characters shortened to < 80

coreplustest.fth
   - >IN manipulation test modified to work on 16 bit systems

doubletest.fth
   - tests D< acts on MS cells of double words

facilitytest.fth
   - the test T{ 0 CF33 ALIGNED -> 0 F33 }T is incorrect and replaced with
     T{ 0 CF33 CHAR+ ALIGNED -> 0 F33 }T
     T{ 0 F33 ALIGNED -> 0 F33 }T

   - S\" tests added
   - BUFFER: tests added
   - Empty CASE statements tested
   - [COMPILE] tests removed as it is obsolescent in Forth 2012

   - additional CASE family test

searchordertest.fth

All tests work with both tester.fr and ttester.fs

coreplustest.fth
   - multiple ELSE's in an IF statement
   - DO +LOOP tests with large increments
   - Ackermann function test for RECURSE added
   - >IN manipulation in interpreter mode
   - immediate CONSTANTs, VARIABLEs and CREATEd words tested
   - recursive :NONAME definitions moved to core extension test file
   - parsing behaviour of S" ." and ( tested

coreexttest.fth
   - SAVE-INPUT and RESTORE-INPUT tests modified to work with ttester.fs
   - CONVERT test deleted, obsolete word removed from Forth 200X
   - immediate VALUEs tested
   - recursive :NONAME tests added
   - PARSE and .( tests added
   - Parsing behaviour of C" tested

doubletest.fth
   - immediate 2CONSTANTs and 2VARIABLEs tested

memorytest.fth
   - Definition of CHECKMEM modified to work with ttester.fs

toolstest.fth
   - Further tests on [IF] [ELSE] [THEN]

Version 0.8
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - Tests added to stringtests.fth

Version 0.7
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - Includes a readme.html.
   - Name changes to avoid redefinition warnings.

Version 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - corrected the case of some words to ensure the tests will run on a
     case-sensitive system

Version 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - includes a correction to the file-access tests.

Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~
   - to make some tests independent of cell size
   - to use T{ and }T instead of { and } as the test words. This avoids
     a clash with the Forth 200X use of { and } for Locals.
