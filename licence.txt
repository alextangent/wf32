     The original Win32Forth system was public domain. Although the basic
     structure of Win32Forth (for instance, meta compilation) and many of
     its capabilities are employed in this code, all of the original
     Win32Forth kernel and the assembler, and much of the supporting code,
     has been completely rewritten. 
     
     The original code was originally developed by Tom Zimmer, Andrew
     McKewan with minor contributions by others and placed in the public
     domain. I acknowledge their copyrighted contributions and the
     structure and some of the methods and concepts employed in this
     further development.
     
     Each file has either a BSD licence (see below) or a note explaining
     the provenance; normally, borrowed from the public domain Win32Forth.
     If there are any discrepancies or copyright issues, please contact me
     at alex at rivadpm dot com and I will endeavour to correct the
     licence, remove or rewrite out the copyrighted code.
